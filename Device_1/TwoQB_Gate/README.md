# CR_Gate

## Description:

In the field of quantum-computing gate operation, Cross resonance (CR) gate is one of ways to implement 2-qubit gate. The code includes 

1. Numerical simulation of CR gates with experimental parameters [1]

2. Optimal control, in order to search for the best pulse shape [2]

## Task:
1. I do the optimal control for the echo-away scheme (see Two_Pulses)
2. I do the optimal control for the single-pulse scheme (see Single_Pulses)
3. I consider the decoherence of the device (see Decoherence)
 
## Usage
1. Requirements: MATLAB 2016 or above
2. Download the code by

	git clone https://github.com/YanChengWeiTony/CR_gate.git
	cd CR_gate
