# Descriptions:


### Calculate_Required_CR_Parms_For_subspace_Numerical: Based on my simplified theory, I approximate the value needed for CR gate


### GateTime_160: 
1. Apply Echo-Away Methods
2. Assume pi pulses are ideal
3. Optimal control on CR gate (x, y-direction)
4. gate time = 160 ns
5. without decoherence
