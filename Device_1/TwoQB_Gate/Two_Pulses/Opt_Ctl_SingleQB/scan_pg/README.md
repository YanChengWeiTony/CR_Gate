### FRAME: Interacting FRAME (second qubit)
1. Find that for 1st qubit's pumping: par_XI_import 's output matches the real gradient value well
2. Yet, for 2nd  qubit's pumping: par_XI_import 's output does not match the real gradient value.. 
3. Also, following by 2, the landscape is totally different, so it cannot be solved by simply multipling a constant.
