# Description:
It is to numerical simulate the single-qubit gate. Here is x gate. The reason is that as the interaction appears, the single-qubit gate might not be able to run perfectly, as its dynamics is also affected by the other qubits.

# Tasks
1. With driving fields only on the target qubit.
see the directoy: gatetime_x, x=5, 10, 15, 20, 50
